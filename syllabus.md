## Disclaimers

Communication from the instructor will only be sent through official UC Davis email addresses and channels. Please be vigilant of job scams impersonating faculty members. For more information, visit [UC Davis Job Scams Prevention](https://icc.ucdavis.edu/find/scams).

Please be nice to each other.
UC Davis has [policies against harassment and discrimination](https://hr.ucdavis.edu/departments/elr/preventing-discrimination-harassment).
Be inclusive of everyone in group discussions, especially those who may not initially speak up (for example, go around and ask what each person thinks).
If you need to, you may reach me by email to report an issue with a classmate.
