## Paper title

## Scope

5 levels:
PL -> Subarea -> Research topic -> Research problem -> Research solution

Try to keep each one brief (at most 3-5 words). It's OK to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity here!

How to pick the levels:
1. Area should always be PL
2. Subarea of PL -- I suggest using one of these options:
        Types
        Compilers
        Language Design
        Verification
        Testing
        Static Analysis
        Systems and Security
        Concurrency and Parallelism
        Logic and Semantics
        ML and Synthesis
    You may also pick a different subarea if you think none of these fit!
3. Research topic: what general area or set of problems do they address?
4. Research problem: what problem does their work address?
5. Potential solution: what is their insight to address the problem?
