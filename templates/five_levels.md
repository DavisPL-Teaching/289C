# Five levels exercise

The five levels exercise helps contextualize the scope
and research area of a paper, and what areas you
might want to understand in order to get a deep
grasp of what the paper is about.

How to pick the levels:

1. Area should always be PL
2. Subarea of PL -- I suggest using one of these options:
        Types
        Compilers
        Language Design
        Verification
        Testing
        Static Analysis
        Systems and Security
        Concurrency and Parallelism
        Logic and Semantics
        ML and Synthesis
    You may also pick a different subarea if you think none of these fit!
3. Research topic: what general area or set of problems do they address?
4. Research problem: what problem does their work address?
5. Potential solution: what is their insight to address the problem?
