# ECS 289C: Seminar in Programming Languages - Spring Quarter 2024

## Course Information

- **Instructor:** Caleb Stanford
- **CRN:** 57017
- **Listed Title:** Special Topics in Programming Languages and Compilers
- **Schedule:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday 2:10-3pm
- **Location:** Giedt 1006

## Course Description

Welcome! This course is a graduate seminar.
We will cover topics in programming languages and related areas at a research level. Topics include: programming language design, type systems, program testing and bug-finding, program verification, side effects, system-building, and applications. The primary focus of the course will be on reading papers and in-class discussions. There will also be a final project to synthesize 3 papers in an area of your choosing into either a research report or an implementation.

This seminar will be discussion-based; as such, a small part of your grade is based on attendance. I also encourage you to engage with the material through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lt90mfmxztd4zy) and [Perusall](https://app.perusall.com/join/stanford-mbthq).
Most course announcements will be through Piazza.
The paper readings can be found on Perusall.

## Expected Work

To help you get the most of the readings, there will be a Piazza thread where everyone should post their overall thoughts on the reading for each week.
For example, what did you like about the paper? What did you not like about the paper? What questions do you have?
In addition, you may use Piazza and Perusall to help with reading and understanding the material.

One student will be assigned to lead each discussion.
That means that each student will lead about one discussion every 2 weeks (4 discussions total), depending on the final number of students enrolled.
For discussion leads, I recommend that you start with a short presentation about the main ideas in the paper (about ~15 minutes, max. 10 slides), including things you liked and didnt' like, followed by 10 slides with questions for discussion (1 question per slide).

(This structure is subject to change; if needed we may adapt as the class progresses to ensure the format is useful, engaging, and inclusive.)

Lastly, there will be a final project which consists of one of two options:
1. A software project of your choice to explore an idea covered in 2-3 papers in an active research area;
2. A written report to compare 2-3 papers in an active research area.

## Intended Audience

This course is intended for graduate students in computer science or ECE.
No prior background or research experience in programming languages will be required.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:
- Read a research paper and think critically about its findings.
- Lead and participate in research-level discussions.
- Understand the foundational ideas and ways of thinking in programming languages.
- Understand the main active areas of research in programming languages.

## Course Schedule

See `schedule.md`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Attendance (10%)** -- Note: you will be allowed a buffer of 3 free absences; please don't attend class if you are sick. If you need to be absent for more than 3 classes, let me know.
- **Reading summaries (20%)** -- posted on Piazza for each paper.
- **Discussion leads (20%)** -- based on the discussions that you individually lead.
- **Final Project or Final Report (50%)** -- this includes a final presentation.

## AI Policy

I encourage the use of AI if it helps your workflow (for example, to help you understand the readings).
You should be prepared to discuss the material in class, including any comments you write.

## Contact and office hours

Please use the Piazza for questions related to course material.
If you have a question that is more sensitive or unrelated to the course, please email me at (`cdstanford` `ucdavis` `edu`).
I will also be available during office hours if you need any additional support.
