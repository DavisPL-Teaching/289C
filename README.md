# ECS 289C: Seminar in Programming Languages - Spring Quarter 2024

## Course Information

- **Instructor:** Caleb Stanford
- **CRN:** 57017
- **Listed Title:** Special Topics in Programming Languages and Compilers
- **Schedule:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday 2:10-3pm
- **Location:** Giedt 1006

## Course Description

Welcome! This course is a graduate seminar.
We will cover topics in programming languages and related areas at a research level. Topics include: programming language design, type systems, program testing and bug-finding, program verification, side effects, system-building, and applications. The primary focus of the course will be on reading papers and assigned presentations. There will also be a final project to synthesize 3 papers in an area of your choosing into either a research report or an implementation.

## Expected Work

The main focus of the course will be on reading papers and class discussions.
One student will be assigned to present each paper.
That means that each student will lead about one presentation every 2 weeks, or 4 presentations total, depending on the final number of students enrolled.

Besides the presenter, everyone else should also come prepared with notes of what they liked or didn't like about the paper under discussion, and any questions they had about it.
To encourage discussions, there will be a small amount of participation credit.

There will also be a final project which consists of one of two options:
1. A software project of your choice to explore an idea covered in 2-3 papers in an active research area;
2. A written report to compare 2-3 papers in an active research area.

## Intended Audience

This course is intended for graduate students in computer science or ECE.
No prior background or research experience in programming languages will be required.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:
- Understand the foundational ideas and ways of thinking in programming languages
- Understand the main active areas of research in programming languages
- Read a research paper and think critically about its findings
- Prepare a presentation about a research paper
- Lead and participate in research-level discussions.

## Course Schedule

See `schedule.md`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Discussion leads (20%):** Based on the discussions that you individually lead.
- **Weekly reports (20%):** Weekly reports on the readings for that week.
- **Weekly participation (10%):** I expect everyone will get these points.
- **Final Project or Final Report (50%)** You may choose either one.

## AI Policy

I encourage the use of AI to collaborate and help you understand readings.
However, you should be prepared to discuss the material in class, including any comments you write.
Using AI assistants too heavily can prevent you from thinking critically about research on your own.

## Contact and office hours

Please use the Piazza for questions related to course material.
I also plan to use Piazza for paper discussions.
If you have a question that is more sensitive or unrelated to the course, please email me at (`cdstanford` `ucdavis` `edu`).
I will also be available during office hours if you need any additional support.

## Disclaimers

Communication from the instructor will only be sent through official UC Davis email addresses and channels. Please be vigilant of job scams impersonating faculty members. For more information, visit [UC Davis Job Scams Prevention](https://icc.ucdavis.edu/find/scams).

Please be nice to each other.
UC Davis has [policies against harassment and discrimination](https://hr.ucdavis.edu/departments/elr/preventing-discrimination-harassment).
Be inclusive of everyone in group discussions, especially those who may not initially speak up (for example, go around and ask what each person thinks).
If you need to, you may reach me by email to report an issue with a classmate.
